# Notifier Templating
The notifier templates are built with a templating language called [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) and anything that is a valid Jinja message is valid for crypto-signal. The options available are as follows:

- exchange - The name of the exchange for the indicator.
- market - The name of the market for the indicator.
- analyzer - The name of the analyzer used for this indicator.
- analyzer_number - Which configured instance of the analyzer this indicator applies too.
- status - Whether the indicator is hot, cold or neutral.
- string_values - A pre-formatted string representation of the indicator values.
- raw_indicator.result.values - The raw tuple of values from the indicator.
- raw_indicator.result.is_hot - The raw boolean value of if the indicator is hot.
- raw_indicator.result.is_cold - The raw boolean value of if the indicator is cold.
- raw_indicator.config.enabled - The raw config item of if this indicator is enabled. If you receive a message with a value other than True something has gone horribly wrong.
- raw_indicator.config.alert_enabled - The raw config item of if this indicator alert is enabled. If you receive a message with a value other than True something has gone horribly wrong.
- raw_indicator.config.alert_frequency - The raw config item of whether this alert is always sent or if it is only sent once per status change.
- raw_indicator.config.hot - The raw config item of what the configured hot threshold is.
- raw_indicator.config.cold - The raw config item of what the configured cold threshold is.
- raw_indicator.config.candle_period - The raw config item of what time period of candles to gather.
- raw_indicator.config.period_count - The raw config item of how many candles to gather.

As an example of how to use it, lets say you want to write a custom message for discord... it would end up looking something like...

```
NOTIFIERS_DISCORD_OPTIONAL_TEMPLATE="[{{raw_indicator.config.candle_period}}] {{market}} on {{exchange}} is {{status}}"
```

The result of the above custom template would generate a message that looks like: [1h] BURST/BTC on bittrex is hot.

# Analyzers
Settings for the analyzers behaviour. The formal grammar is defined as follows:
```
<indicator> := <indicator_name>_<indicator_index>

<indicator_name> := MOMENTUM |
                    RSI |
                    MACD |
                    SMA |
                    SMA_CROSSOVER |
                    EMA |
                    EMA_CROSSOVER |
                    ICHIMOKU |
                    STOCHASTIC_RSI

<indicator_index> := {0, 1, 2, ...}
```

Valid settings for indicators:

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator_name\>_NUM_INDICATORS*\
default: 1\
necessity: optional\
description: Valid values are positive integers. This tells Crypto-Signal how many of the same indicator to keep track of.

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator\>_ENABLED*\
default: True\
necessity: optional\
description: Valid values are true or false. Whether to perform analysis on this indicator.

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator\>_ALERT_ENABLED*\
default: True\
necessity: optional\
description: Valid values are true or false. Whether to send alerts for this particular indicator.

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator\>_HOT*\
default:\
necessity: optional\
description: A valid option must be an integer or float. This is the number at which you want this indicator to become hot. For some indicators that is when it is above a threshold and for some it is below a threshold... this is automatically handled by the indicator you just need to provide the value.

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator\>_COLD*\
default:\
necessity: optional\
description: A valid option must be an integer or float. This is the number at which you want this indicator to become cold. For some indicators that is when it is above a threshold and for some it is below a threshold... this is automatically handled by the indicator you just need to provide the value.

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator\>_CANDLE_PERIOD*\
default: 1d\
necessity: optional\
description: Valid options vary by exchange, common options include 1m, 5m, 1h, 4h, 1d. This dictates what granularity of rollup to use for the analyzed candles, so a candle period of 1d will roll the candles up to 1 day blocks.

*BEHAVIOUR_\<indicator\>_PERIOD_COUNT*\
default:\
  SMA/EMA Crossovers: 15/21
  Other indicators: An integer
necessity: optional\
description: Valid options are an integer. This is the count of candle periods to use for this analysis. Let's suppose you wanted to test 15 days of EMA data. You would set the `BEHAVIOUR_EMA_0_CANDLE_PERIOD=1d` and then set `BEHAVIOUR_EMA_0_PERIOD_COUNT=15`, which means 15 counts of 1d periods... or in other words... 15 days. Furthermore, you can also keep track of the same indicator with multiple period lengths. If we wanted to watch the 15, 21, and 50 day EMA simultaneously, we could set `BEHAVIOUR_EMA_0_PERIOD_COUNT=15`, `BEHAVIOUR_EMA_1_PERIOD_COUNT=21`, `BEHAVIOUR_EMA_2_PERIOD_COUNT=50`.

\* When dealing with the SMA_CROSSOVER and EMA_CROSSOVER indicators, the PERIOD_COUNT setting takes two integers separated by a forward-slash. So if we wanted to know when the 15 SMA crosses over the 21 SMA, we could set `BEHAVIOUR_SMA_CROSSOVER_0_PERIOD_COUNT=15/21`.

To hammer home this unique (and perhaps arcane) method of configuration, consider how we can translate the following example into a proper configuration using the grammar above:

- 21-period RSI over daily candlesticks
- 50-period RSI over hourly candlesticks
- 9-period hourly SMA
- SMA-Crossing between the 15 and 21 daily SMA's

This is the respective configuration for settings.env:

```
BEHAVIOUR_RSI_NUM_INDICATORS=2
BEHAVIOUR_RSI_0_CANDLE_PERIOD=1d
BEHAVIOUR_RSI_0_PERIOD_COUNT=21
BEHAVIOUR_RSI_1_CANDLE_PERIOD=1h
BEHAVIOUR_RSI_1_PERIOD_COUNT=50
BEHAVIOUR_SMA_0_PERIOD_COUNT=9
BEHAVIOUR_SMA_0_CANDLE_PERIOD=1h
BEHAVIOUR_SMA_CROSSING_0_PERIOD_COUNT=15/21
BEHAVIOUR_SMA_CROSSING_0_CANDLE_PERIOD=1d
```
Notice that we don't need to specify the _NUM_INDICATORS_ option if we are only using a single instance of an indicator.

# Exchanges
Settings that alter behaviour of interaction with an exchange.

*EXCHANGES_exchangeid_REQUIRED_ENABLED*\
default: False\
necessity: required\
description: Valid options are `true` or `false`. This setting enables or disables exchanges by specifying their id where specified in the variable name for bittrex the variable would be called `EXCHANGES_BITTREX_REQUIRED_ENABLED`. A list of exchange id's can be found [here](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki/Exchange-Markets). In order to use crypto-signal you must set one exchange to true.

# Example
Putting it all together an example settings.env might look like the config below if you want to use the default settings with bittrex

```
EXCHANGES_BITTREX_REQUIRED_ENABLED=true
```

If you want to filter to a specific set of markets and receive updates hourly:

```
SETTINGS_MARKET_PAIRS=ETH/BTC,DOGE/BTC
SETTINGS_UPDATE_INTERVAL=3600
EXCHANGES_BITTREX_REQUIRED_ENABLED=true
```
